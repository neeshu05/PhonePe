An image is represented by an m x n integer grid image where image[i][j] represents the pixel value of the image.

You are also given three integers sr, sc, and color. You should perform a flood fill on the image starting from the pixel image[sr][sc].

To perform a flood fill, consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel of the same color as the starting pixel,
plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels (also with the same color), and so on. Replace the color of all of the aforementioned pixels with color.

//
n,m = len(image),len(image[0])
def helper(image,r,c,color):
    if r<0 or c<0 or r == len(image) or c == len(image[0]) or image[r][c] != color or image[r][c] == newColor:
        return
    if image[r][c] == color:
        image[r][c] = newColor
    helper(image,r+1,c,color)
    helper(image,r-1,c,color)
    helper(image,r,c+1,color)
    helper(image,r,c-1,color)
    #return image
helper(image,sr,sc,image[sr][sc])
return image
